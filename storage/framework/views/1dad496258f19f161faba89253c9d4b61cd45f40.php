		Mutual Fund Community (MfC) 
		
                </ul>
                
		<br/>Our Motto:
		<ul>
			"We make a living by what we get. 
			 We make a life by what we give."
			   - Winston Churchill 
                </ul>
                
		<br/>Our Values:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Transparency</li>
			<li>Objectivity</li>
			<li>Swiftness</li>
		</ul>

		<br />Mutual Fund Community is NOT a bank, a ponzi scheme or an hyip. Neither is it a 'get-rich-quick' platform. It engages in NO fraudulent activity that could be a daint on its name, public image and national integrity. MfC is a reputable community platform that is prepared to improve the lives of Nigerians through transparent community activities.
		</ul>

		<br />Mutual Fund Community gives the privilege and provides the platform for every of its member to be able to donate and fund the cause of other members of the community and also have access to a weekly and consistent inflow of funding rewards through the freewill donations of other members of the community. Donations are received back with 100% after six (6) days of confirmation.
		</ul>

		<br />These funding rewards are to be used in meeting urgent financial needs, saving a collapsing business in the present failing economy, building and sustaining legitimate businesses by members who are also recipients of these rewards, paying important bills and easing out living conditions while improving the standard of living of every Nigerian in general.

		MfC accommodates professionals, entrepreneurs, students and the presently unemployed who are able to make use of the Internet or who do have siblings and relatives to help them out with the use of it, daring to achieve their dreams. There are NO discriminations on MfC. 
		
		</ul>

		<br />

		No Recommitment Fees Of Any Kind! 

		We take with all seriousness, the integrity of MfC and do not handle with levity, suspicious activities within the community. Actions that work against the growth, development and goodwill of the community would be dealt with severely. 

		MfC is a stable platform that guarantees several years of community activity premised on the confidence and trust that we have in each of our reliable participating members to be cooperative with the system, hardworking with recruitment of new members and purposeful with the commitment to grow with the community over the next few years (at least 4 years) before which a new and higher phase of the community would be unveiled to last even longer. For this reasons, there are NO recommitment fees of any kind. 

		Join the trusted growing MfC community today!
