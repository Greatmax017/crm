                        <p>There is a risk involved with investing in all high yield investment programs. However, there are a few simple
                            ways that can help you to reduce the risk of losing more than you can afford to. First, align your investments
                            with your financial goals, in other words, keep the money you may need for the short-term out of more
                            aggressive investments, reserving those investment funds for the money you intend to raise over the
                            long-term. It's very important for you to know that we are real traders and that we invest members'
                            funds on major investments.
